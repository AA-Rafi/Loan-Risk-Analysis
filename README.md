# Project 4 Proposal: Credit Risk Analysis for Loan Portfolio 

Members: Abdullah Ar Rafi
## Description
In this project, I will analyze and assess the credit risk associated with a loan portfolio. The dataset should include information about borrowers, loan details, repayment history, credit scores, and other relevant financial metrics. The goal is to gain insights into the risk profile of the portfolio and identify potential areas of concern.

## Technology Deployed:

Data Exploration with SQL: Starting by exploring the loan portfolio dataset using light SQL queries. Understand the data's structure and perform basic data cleaning to ensure it's ready for analysis.
Python and Pandas: Light ETL to clean unusable/unclean segments of the data.  
Tableau Story: Used to create a comprehensive Tableau story that presents an overview of the loan portfolio's credit risk. Visualizations to display the distribution of credit scores, loan amounts, and repayment patterns. Highlight any patterns or trends that could indicate higher risk segments.
HTML/CSS/JS Visuals: Deployed to enhance the Tableau story by embedding custom HTML/CSS/JS visuals. 

## Timeline
1.	Data Collection (July 22nd)

2.	ETL (July 24th-25th) 
a.	Import the dataset into Tableau and explore its structure.
b.	Clean and preprocess the data if needed (e.g., handle missing values, data type conversions).
c.	Perform basic data profiling to understand data distributions and outliers.

3.	Initial Visualizations (July 25th – July 26th)
a.	Create initial visualizations to get a sense of the data's story.
b.	Visualize simple relationships, such as loan amount vs. income, loan approval rates, etc.
c.	Begin organizing the visualizations into worksheets and dashboards.

4.	Data Analysis: Define Story Narrative and Key Questions (July 27th)
a.	Define the overarching narrative of the Tableau story.
b.	Identify the key questions I want to answer through your visualizations.
c.	Structure the story around answering these questions.

5.	Advanced Visualizations (July 28th – July 29th)
a.	Create more sophisticated visualizations to explore relationships between different variables (e.g., income vs. loan amount by gender, education, marital status).
b.	Utilize interactive features like filters, parameters, and tooltips to allow users to explore the data.

6.	Tableau Story (July 30th – July 31st) 
a.	Organize the visualizations into a logical flow that tells a cohesive story.
b.	Arrange the visualizations into a Tableau dashboard to create a story.
c.	Ensure that the flow of the story makes sense and leads to meaningful insights.

7.	Debugging/ Refining (Aug 1st – 2nd)
